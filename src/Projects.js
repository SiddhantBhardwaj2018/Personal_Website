              In this project, I built a WhatsApp inspired Chatroom Web-App in
              users can log in using their Google accounts in order to create or
              enter existing chatrooms and speak with members of these
              chatrooms. The project utilizes React on the frontend, Material-UI
              for the design aspect, Firebase for database and hosting and Redux
              for state management.

              In this project, I built a Covid-19 Tracker in which you can track
              daily Covid-19 metrics for cases, recoveries and deaths based on
              the Worldometer API along with their graphical and grographical
              visualization for the last 120 days. The project utilizes React on
              the frontend, Material-UI for the design aspect, Firebase for

              In this project, I built a simple Facebook Messenger Clone in
              which users can chat with each other. The application is designed
              to be a open forum where anybody logging in the forum will be able
              to chat with anybody else. The project utilizes React on the

              React. All you need to do is enter your language of choice, the
              location and full-time or part-time preference and the app returns
              a list of available job offers. This project was hosted on GitHub
              Pages.

              of the GitHub Pages hosting service. The project uses React on the
              frontend and Material-UI for design purposes.

              Keeping track of and managing your finances is something most
              college students take some time to learn. In keeping with this
              idea, I decided to build an expense tracker app in React that
              would allow the user to track his or her expenses.This was hosted
              on Github Pages.

              Breaking Bad API and was hosted on Github Pages
